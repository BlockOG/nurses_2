nurses_2 FAQ
############

What's up with the name?
------------------------
The original nurses was a portmanteau of NumPy and curses. nurses_2 no longer
depends on curses, but I kept the name.

Why a library for terminal graphics?
------------------------------------
You got me. This is a very niche library written *mostly* for my own amusement
and education. If your not excited by any of one the numerous
`examples <https://github.com/salt-die/nurses_2/tree/main/examples>`_ then
probably this project isn't for you.
