# nurses_2 - terminal graphics

> A continuation and rewrite of [nurses](https://www.github.com/salt-die/nurses). [nurses](https://www.github.com/salt-die/nurses) is dead. `nurses_2` depends on [prompt-toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit) instead of curses. `nurses_2` is meant for vt100 enabled, true color terminals.  (No support otherwise.)

This is a widget and async-centric library for creating graphical applications in the terminal.
Only the truly mad would venture here; here be dragons.
