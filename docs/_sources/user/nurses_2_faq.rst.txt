nurses_2 FAQ
############

What's up with the name?
------------------------
The original nurses was a portmanteau of NumPy and curses. nurses_2 no longer
depends on curses, but I kept the name.

Why a library for terminal graphics?
------------------------------------
I like to create visualizations in the terminal. It's not more complicated than that.
