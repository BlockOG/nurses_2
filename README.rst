nurses_2 - Terminal Graphics
============================

A widget and async-centric library for creating graphical applications in the terminal.

To create a nurses_2 app, inherit the ``App`` class and implement the ``on_start`` asynchronous method.
There are dozens of `examples <https://github.com/salt-die/nurses_2/tree/main/examples>`_ to help get you started.
